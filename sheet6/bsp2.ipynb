It will never reach the ending condition, causing a crash.\n","    - avoid runtime errors by thinking through the flow of your code before running it (especially loops) and carefully plan out your code before writing -> Pseudocode\n","- Logic Errors\n","    - The code runs smoothly without runtime or syntax errors, but the result isnt what you wanted\n","    - often the hardest type of errors to solve\n","        - most of the time, the error is unknown to the programmer\n","        - eg. we want the sum but write the multiplication sign instead\n","\n","Because of logic errors, we want to test our code incrementally.\n","\n","### What is incremental development?\n","Test your application often so that if you mess up, you know where the error is.  \n","\n","### Strategies for debugging and fixing bugs?\n","\n","    Debugging  \n","    \n","- First step is to read the error\n","    - IDE will often print out an error message to the console\n","- Traverse to the line of code provided by the error\n","- Use online forums such as StackOverflow\n","- When a syntax or runtime error pops up, you should be able to find a fix for it fairly easily\n","- How to fix a logic error:\n","    - Use print statements in the console to determine where the code went wrong; e.g. when a variable was set wrong somewhere in the code before your if statement, and than the if statement is printed wrong\n","    - use a breakpoint\n","        - pauses the program when the line you placed the breakpoint at is reached until you continue\n","    \n","###  .\n","    Fixing a bug\n","    \n","- When you think you've found the section of code causing the error\n","    - first try commenting it out \n","        - allows us to mark-up the code withour the computer reading it as actual code\n","        - essentially a documentation tool for programmer\n","        - go through the lines until you find it; fix it or delete the line completely until you have a fully functional program\n","\n","### .\n","    Preventing errors\n","- Backup code frequently\n","- Version managers such as GitHub or SubVersion can help\n","    - backup code to an online cloud service in which you can easily pull previous versions of the program\n","- Useful for backtracking to find when the error was written\n","- Run your program frequently\n","    - prevents you from saving a backup that doesn't work\n","    - makes it easier to figure out when you wrote the error\n","\n","### What is GitHub?\n","a Version manager see above\n","\n","### How did yk determine why his code wasn't working?\n","\n","1. Come up with hypothesis and test it. Repeat.\n","2. Reproduce the problem (bug) locally.\n","3. Read the source code carefully.\n","4. Use print statement effectively. \n","5. Use a debugger effectively.\n","\n","(Pdb) p response.__dict__.keys()\n","\n","(Pdb) p response._content\n","\n","yk got the error message: \"Could not authenticate you\" because he did not use the correct password of his twitter account, missing a letter when copying it and spending 4 hours debugging.\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3.10.6 64-bit","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.10.6"},"orig_nbformat":4,"vscode":{"interpreter":{"hash":"916dbcbb3f70747c44a77c7bcd40155683ae19c65e1c03b4aa3499c5328201f1"}},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
