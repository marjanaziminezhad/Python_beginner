    "One simple BLAST output format is the tabular format (example). BLAST reports alignments in the order that the query sequences were provided, and does a secondary sorting by bit score.\n",

    "1. Write a script that reads and filters a file of tabular BLAST results. You can use the provided template if you want. The script should output a given number of best hits for each query, if the bit score (similarity, higher is better) of the hit is above a user-given threshold, and the E-value (significance, lower is better) of the hit is below a user-given threshold. \n",
    "\n",
    "    The script:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ... accepts 3 or 4 command line arguments:\n",
    "    - Input file name\n",
    "    - Bit score B\n",
    "    - E-value E\n",
    "    - Number of hits N (optional, default is 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "    ... reads a file of tabular BLAST results\n",
    "\n",
    "    ... writes at most N best hits for each query to the standard output, if the bit score is at least B, and the E-value is not higher than E\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write a second version of the script that reads the BLAST results from standard input. It should accept 2 or 3 command line arguments.\n",
    "You can test the scripts using the tabular BLAST output from a previous exercise. It's a good idea to select some lines that should pass or fail the filter (e.g. bit score too low and/or E-value too high) to test the script."
