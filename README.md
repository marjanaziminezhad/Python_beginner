# Python Programming Course - Exercise Sheets

Welcome to my Python Programming Course repository! Here you'll find a collection of exercise sheets and solutions from my Python programming course at FHWN . These exercises are designed to help learners, especially beginners, practice Python programming concepts and improve their coding skills.

## Repository Structure

- Each exercise sheet is provided in a separate folder and contains a series of coding exercises.
- The solutions to each exercise are included in the respective exercise sheet folder.
- You can explore the code to see how each exercise was solved.

## Exercise Topics

The exercise sheets cover a variety of Python programming topics, including but not limited to:

- Variables and Data Types
- Control Structures (e.g., if statements, loops)
- Functions and Modules
- File Handling
